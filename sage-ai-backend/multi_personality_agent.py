Multi-Personality Debate Agent for Sage AI
==========================================

This is the CORRECT implementation following LiveKit Agents official patterns.
It replaces our complex audio bridge system with a simple, standard approach
that manages all 5 AI debate personalities in a single worker.

Based on Context7 MCP analysis of official LiveKit Agents documentation.
