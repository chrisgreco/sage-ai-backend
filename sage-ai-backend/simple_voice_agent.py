Simple LiveKit Voice Agent for Sage AI
======================================

This uses the much simpler OpenAI Realtime API approach that eliminates
the need for our complex audio bridge system. The Realtime API handles
all voice processing automatically.

Based on official LiveKit Agents documentation.
