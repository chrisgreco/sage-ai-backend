# 🎭 Live Testing Guide: Knowledge-Enhanced Agents

## 🎊 What You've Accomplished

✅ **Downloaded 7 specialized PDF sources (4.6 MB total)**
- 🏛️ Solon: 3 parliamentary procedure guides
- ❓ Socrates: 1 critical thinking framework
- 🌉 Hermes: 1 systems thinking manual  
- ☮️ Buddha: 2 Buddhist conflict resolution guides

✅ **Agents now have domain expertise**
- Parliamentary procedures & Robert's Rules
- Socratic questioning techniques
- Systems thinking frameworks
- Mindful conflict resolution

## 🚀 How to Test Live

### 1. Start Your AI Debate System
```bash
cd sage-ai-backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Join a Debate Room
- Open your web interface
- Create or join a debate room
- The 5 philosophical agents will be available

### 3. Test Knowledge-Specific Questions

#### 🏛️ Test Solon's Parliamentary Knowledge
Ask during debates:
- "Solon, how should we handle interruptions?"
- "What's the proper procedure for amending this topic?"
- "How do we maintain order when people disagree?"

**Expected Enhancement:** Solon will cite specific parliamentary procedures and Robert's Rules instead of generic responses.

#### ❓ Test Socrates' Questioning Techniques  
Ask during debates:
- "Socrates, what assumptions are we making here?"
- "How can we think about this more clearly?"
- "What questions should we be asking?"

**Expected Enhancement:** Socrates will use the 6 types of Socratic questions and critical thinking frameworks.

#### 🌉 Test Hermes' Systems Thinking
Ask during debates:
- "Hermes, how do these different views connect?"
- "What's the bigger picture here?"
- "What patterns do you see in this discussion?"

**Expected Enhancement:** Hermes will apply systems thinking tools and causal loop analysis.

#### ☮️ Test Buddha's Conflict Resolution
Ask during debates:
- "Buddha, how can we discuss this more peacefully?"
- "What's causing the conflict here?"
- "How do we find common ground?"

**Expected Enhancement:** Buddha will use specific Buddhist meditation and conflict resolution techniques.

## 🎯 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Parliamentary Procedure Test
1. Start a debate with a controversial topic
2. Have participants interrupt each other
3. Ask Solon to moderate
4. Watch for specific parliamentary language and procedures

### Scenario 2: Assumption Challenge
1. Have someone make a strong claim
2. Ask Socrates to examine the assumptions
3. Look for the 6 types of Socratic questions
4. See if hidden beliefs are revealed

### Scenario 3: Systems Integration
1. Present two seemingly opposing viewpoints
2. Ask Hermes to find connections
3. Look for systems thinking terminology
4. Watch for pattern recognition

### Scenario 4: Conflict De-escalation
1. Let a debate get heated
2. Ask Buddha to intervene
3. Look for mindful communication techniques
4. See if underlying needs are addressed

## 📊 What to Look For

### Before Knowledge Enhancement:
- Generic responses based on personality
- Basic philosophical concepts
- Simple conflict resolution
- Limited specialized terminology

### After Knowledge Enhancement:
- **Solon:** Cites Robert's Rules, uses parliamentary terminology
- **Socrates:** Uses specific questioning frameworks, reveals assumptions systematically
- **Hermes:** Applies systems thinking tools, identifies causal loops
- **Buddha:** Uses Buddhist conflict resolution, guides mindful breathing

## 🧪 Sample Test Questions by Complexity

### Beginner Level:
- "How should we handle this disagreement?"
- "What questions should we ask?"
- "How do these ideas connect?"

### Intermediate Level:
- "What parliamentary procedure applies here?"
- "What assumptions underlie this argument?"
- "What system dynamics are at play?"

### Advanced Level:
- "How do we formally amend this motion according to Robert's Rules?"
- "Apply the six types of Socratic questions to this claim"
- "Use systems thinking to map these feedback loops"

## 🎬 Expected Debate Flow

1. **🏛️ Solon** opens with formal parliamentary procedures
2. **❓ Socrates** clarifies terms and challenges assumptions
3. **🧠 Aristotle** fact-checks with Perplexity research (existing feature)
4. **🌉 Hermes** synthesizes using systems thinking
5. **☮️ Buddha** maintains peace with Buddhist techniques

## 📈 Measuring Success

Your knowledge enhancement is working if you see:

✅ **Specific terminology** from the PDF sources
✅ **Structured approaches** following the methodologies
✅ **Referenced procedures** rather than improvised responses
✅ **Domain expertise** evident in agent responses
✅ **Coordinated collaboration** between agents using their specialties

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Q: Agents not using specialized knowledge?**
A: The PDFs need to be processed into the vector database. Run the knowledge_base_manager.py integration.

**Q: Responses seem generic?**
A: Make sure to ask knowledge-specific questions that trigger the specialized domains.

**Q: Want to add more knowledge?**
A: Add PDFs to the appropriate agent directories and re-run the processing scripts.
